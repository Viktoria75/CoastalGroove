# CoastalGroove
Final project for the Web Programming course @ Solent University UK 2024 

Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js/EJS + a SQLite database.

This is a website detailing a music festival - Coastal Groove Festival. It has different pages showcasing information about the events taking place in the festival with a small game embedded in one of them. It has a contact page that's connected to the included SQLite database for storing messages towards the event organizers. Uses Express/EJS for routing and layout purposes.

**How to run the website**

Run npm install or yarn install

Run node index.js

You should now be able to view the website by going to http://localhost:5000 !
